# Create custom polygon for Tableau by drawing on a background image

Expanding upon [Keith Wood's impressive work](https://tableauandbehold.com/2015/04/13/creating-custom-polygons-on-a-background-image/), this HTML script introduces additional functionalities such as the ability to remove a saved polygon, clear all drawn lines, and more. These improvements are focused on enhancing the tool's resilience and creating a space for errors while drawing on the background image. In addition, we can export the data without the need to manually copy and paste the data points for saving them as a CSV file, as was required in the original script.

Having said that, this tool is quite basic when contrasted with [Interwork's CBI Studio](https://cbistudio.interworks.com/#), which features more sophisticated interfaces and a sleek appearance. In my personal experience, I found the drawing dots in the CBI Studio somewhat obstructive, especially when I need to draw intricate, small, and curvaceous objects. Consequently, I lean towards Keith's tool for situations involving more complex background images, as it provides a straightforward approach using drawing lines. Not to forget, this script works offline as well! 

## How to use?
1. Download the script and save it in the same folder as the background image you intend to use. 
2. Open the script in a browser (it is highly recommended to use Google Chrome, as it has not been extensively tested with other browsers).
3. Load your background image and start drawing! 
4. Opening the HTML page will provide you with more detailed instructions.
